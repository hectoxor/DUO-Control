## General Troubleshooting

One of the key aspects of troubleshooting is understanding the most common issues that occur in a system. Once those problems, and their indicators, are defined a flow has to be created. For example, a check engine light in a car indicates any number of issues. When a cars check engine light comes on, a mechanic pulls the codes from the car to narrow down the issue to a specific part of the engine. Even if the code leads to a specific part of the engine, like the transmission, it is not always indicative of the exact problem. However, there is a process flow. Each step narrows down the problem to a potential solution. Troubleshooting the REV Control system is no different!The status LED is the REV Control System equivalent to the check engine light mentioned in the example. _Visit the_ [_LED Blink Code_](status-led-blink-codes.md) _section to understand what each code is and what it indicates._Many issues can be solved by systematic troubleshooting without needing to contact REV Support. Take a look at the troubleshooting tips below for help in determining the cause of the issue you are seeing.

The section is divided into general best practices, Control Hub ([REV-31-1595](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1595/)) troubleshooting and Expansion Hub ([REV-31-1153](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1153/)) **** troubleshooting.

### General Best Practices  <a href="#general-best-practices" id="general-best-practices"></a>

Before diving into common troubleshooting paths its important to understand the general guidelines, or best practices, for Control System Health.

* **Charge the Battery** - While a charged battery and phone are crucial to a healthy control system in general; it is also helpful to ensure batteries and phones are charged before a match.
* **Update** - The applications, firmware, and operating system have periodic updates to improve the control system. Keeping the control system up to date ensures the best performance!
* **Isolate the Issue -** This is key to effective troubleshooting. Many issues can show the same symptom, so eliminating failure points one at a time is critical to finding the root cause.

DO NOT plug a battery charger into either the Control Hub or Expansion Hub. It will damage the Hub and cause eventual device failureMaintaining and taking care of the 12V Slim Battery is also important for troubleshooting purposes. All rechargeable batteries have a finite lifespan however following the [best practices for the 12V Slim Battery](../nachalo-raboty-s-control-hub/sleduyushie-shagi.md#slim-battery-best-practices) can extend the lifespan of the battery.
