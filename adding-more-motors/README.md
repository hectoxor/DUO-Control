# Adding More Motors

The Control Hub ([REV-31-1595](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1595/)) and Expansion Hub ([REV-31-1153](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1153/)) can each drive up to four DC brushed motors. As mechanisms are added to the robot the number of motor ports may not be sufficient. There are two ways to add more motors to the Control System, either the SPARKmini Motor Controller ([REV-31-1230](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1230/)) or adding an Expansion Hub. The Following two rules give a general idea of when to choose one method over another:&#x20;

* If one or two motors are needed, consider using the SPARKmini Motor Controller.
* If three to four additional motors are needed, consider adding an Expansion Hub.
