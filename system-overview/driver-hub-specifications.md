# Driver Hub Specifications

The REV Robotics Driver Hub ([REV-31-1596](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1596)) is a compact mobile computing device designed for interfacing with the Control Hub (REV-31-1595). The Driver Hub was designed and built as an easy to use, dependable, and durable device for use in classroom and the competition. It features an Android operating system, built-in dual band Wi-Fi (802.11 ac/b/g/n/w), and support for many off-the-shelf gamepads and HID devices connected through built-in USB ports. When the Driver Hub software is updated with new features, the device can receive a "field upgrade," through a fast and simple update through the [REV Hardware Client](../updating-and-managing/rev-hardware-client.md).&#x20;

The Driver Hub is an approved device for use in FIRST® Global and FIRST Tech Challenge.&#x20;
