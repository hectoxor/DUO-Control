# REV Hub Interface Software

The REV Hub Interface is a beta software allowing for a direct connection from a REV Expansion Hub and its peripherals to a Windows PC.&#x20;

This interface provides a method for teams to prototype with motors, servos, and sensors in a way that is faster and easier than setting up an entire robot control system. It is also a valuable troubleshooting tool that can help isolate the cause of an issue and determine if it is electrical or software related. The REV Hub Firmware can also be updated and recovered through this interface in addition to the Robot Controller Application.
